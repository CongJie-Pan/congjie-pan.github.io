I am a junior at Chung Yuan Christian University, researching <a href="./PDF/The_Construction_of_an_Ancient _Chinese_Knowledge_Query_System.pdf" target="_blank"><strong>knowledge-based question answering system in Ancient Chinese</strong></a> under Professor [Chin-Hui Lai](https://chlai045.github.io/){:target="_blank"}.

My cross-disciplinary background in information management and Ancient Chinese stems from my experiences exploring Ancient Chinese through coursework, earning an top alternate spot in National Taiwan University's department of Chinese transfer exam, and tutoring Chinese in an academic support club at NTU. 

These experiences motivated me to integrate Ancient Chinese with modern information systems by developing a question-answering system, digitizing texts to support teachers, and creating tools to help students learn independently despite limited teacher resources.
